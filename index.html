			<h2>Homepage</h2>
			<p>The navigation bar had to be changed to float left due to coding limitations but still effective nonetheless if not better as typically in Australian culture the expectation is that the eye will flow from left to right therefore catering to the “western style” of reading.</p>
      <p>Having the Home button instead of the logo provides clearer navigation therefore catering to individuals with little internet literacy, the logo also does not need to be reinforced twice on each screen as the logo already appears on each page.</p>
      <p>Coding limitations led to the elements on the website not scaling to an adjusted window or looking from another device. </p>
      <p>Coding limitations and time constraints led to the images not perfectly replicating the final mockups but the ordering gives a solid conceptual idea of what it would eventually look like.</p>
      <p>Implemented the hover colour change in order to signify that the donate button is something you are able to click and get instant access to the donation form.</p>

			<h2>Donations Form</h2>
			<p>Generally stuck to the original design but with limitations of alignment knowledge and time, it was difficult to align exactly with the final mockup but in hindsight the centered labels look better than the labels to the side. It allows you to follow the form straight down and the headings on the side are more of a progress indicator of where you are up to.</p>
      <p>Submit button would further need to be changed to be smaller and fit the desired shape of the submit button in the mockups.</p>
      <p>The heading needed to be taken out as the user does not need a reminder of the page they clicked on.</p>

			<h2>Thanks for Donating Page</h2>
			<p>The design was very simple and was kept consistent with the original mockups with the exception of the nav bar and the shape of the button.</p>
      <p>Implementation of the hover to give incentive to click the button to return you to the homepage.</p>

    <section id="apply">
			<h2>Apply Page</h2>
			<p>Changed the box colours to the light pink as they need to be stylistically consistent with the other forms on the website namely the donations form. The design was also centered to keep the flow of the form.</p>

    <section id="aboutus">
			<h2>About Us Page</h2>
			<p>With time constraints perfecting the alignment of the elements was not able to be achieved however the idea and concept of where the elements would go can be seen easily.</p>
      <p>Placeholder text has been used to signify where the organization’s preferable information text will be placed.</p>
      <p>The div tags under the resources section are used as placeholders for the PDF resource packages provided by the organization.</p>

    <section id="contactus">
			<h2>Contact Us Page</h2>
			<p>With time constraints alignment and scaling could not be addressed as thoroughly but the general concept has been addressed and with more time more detail can be added.</p>
      <p>The submit button would technically have to be submitting data to the organisation and open up a chat so that they can get immediate feedback.</p>
      <p>Placeholder text has been applied as the organization will have specific information they would want to provide in terms of contact information.</p>
